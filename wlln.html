          Language has always been a vital part of who I am and my story. However, I didn’t truly realize the impact
          that language has had in my life until I sat down to write this essay. This essay challenged me to think
          deeper about my own language and literacy journey. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to reflect on
          this journey.
          <br /><br />
          When I wrote this essay, I intended my audience to be other immigrants, specifically children of immigrants
          who must had experience what I have experienced. I wanted my audience to know that they were not alone in
          their struggles, that it’s okay if they felt those same feelings of fear and sadness I felt during the first
          few years in America. So, in my essay, I delved deeper into my feelings, from what I was feeling when I
          entered my first classroom in America to what I was feeling when I chose my book for silent reading time. By
          describing in depth my feelings in these moments, I could take my audience on a trip down memory lane, when
          they felt (or maybe still do feel) this type of way. In addition, I knew a lot of my classmates were going to
          be the ones reading my essay and many of them could relate to my story, so I felt it was important to tell it.
          On the other hand, I would hope that regardless of a personal connection to my narrative, the audience takes
          something away from story, about the struggles that everyday immigrants endure.
          <br /><br />
          In writing this essay, some of the most meaningful insights I have gained are that the more description and
          dialogue, the better. I found myself thoroughly enjoying providing these descriptions and revisiting these
          memories. I have come to realize how much both my writing and reading skills have improved. In writing this
          narrative, I have started to become more vulnerable in my writing. This essay helped me greatly improve the
          description in my writing. Rhetorical situation, purpose, and audience have most impacted my learning and
          writing practices. For example, in writing this essay, I have become very aware of these tools. As I was
          writing it, I pictured the triangular diagram we completed in class. I knew that I was utilizing a lot of
          pathos in my own writing by providing extensive details of my feelings and actions. In addition, I wanted to
          make sure that my essay was easy to read, like Amy Tan mentions in “Mother Tongue.”
          <br /><br />
          This assignment has helped me achieve the following Course Learning Outcomes: “develop strategies for reading,
          drafting, collaborating, revising, and editing” and “engage in the collaborative and social aspects of writing
          processes.” During the process of completing this assignment, I, along with my classmates, spent a great deal
          of time revising and editing our essays. The peer reviews helped me develop strategies for reading, drafting,
          collaborating, revising, and editing. Additionally, during the in-class peer review sessions, I began to
          engage in the collaborative and social aspects of the writing process. In discussing my essay with my peers, I
          developed a friendship and trust with them. Many of us found that we connected with each other’s pieces of
          writing. Moreover, the spoken language and literacy narrative assignment helped me get to know my classmates
          better. Overall, writing my language and literacy narrative was a great learning experience.

                I wish I had known how much I would regret it. It was 11AM and I was standing on line for the teacher to
                check
                homework. Sweat started slowly rolling down the right side of my face. At this point, both of my hands
                were
                drowned in it. My heart began to beat faster. I tried to keep my hands from shaking.

          I got one step closer. There were now 4 more people in front of me.

          I will be fine. He will forget by lunch, I reassured myself, half believing myself. 3, 2, 1...
          <br /><br />
          “Next!” Mr. Akter barked.
          <br /><br />
          “Where’s your homework?” He growled, seeing my empty hands.
          <br /><br />
          “Uhh...mhm...you see....I...” My throat had closed. Somehow my voice had taken a vacation.
          <br /><br />
          “You what?!” He eyed me suspiciously.
          <br /><br />
          “I didn’t do the homework.”
          <br /><br />
          “Hold out your palm,” He muttered.
          <br /><br />
          “I am so sorry-”
          <br /><br />
          “HOLD OUT YOUR HAND!” This time, he bellowed.
          <br /><br />
          I slowly put out my palm, hoping the bell would ring. Maybe the principal would come in.
          <br /><br />
          <i>Oh please. He would just watch and have himself a show.</i>
          <br /><br />
          WHACK! I felt the cold ruler slam against my palm. My palm turned a deep shade of pink. I walked back to my
          desk, looking down at my feet as the other kids laughed.

                When I was younger, I used to hate school. I remember how much I dreaded going. I never felt excited to
                learn
                or make new friends, but instead, I felt scared. The teachers intimidated me. They towered over me,
                holding
                long, sharp rulers in their hands, ready for their next victim. The first time I forgot my homework was
                the
                first time I received the painful WHACK! on my palm. In Bangladesh, there was no rule against hitting
                students
                and as a result, my motivation to learn was fear more than anything else.

                When I was eight years old, my family and I moved to America. All my life, I had only known one country,
                language, and culture. But suddenly, I was thrown into this whole new place. The first day of second
                grade was
                the first time I attended school in America, so it was a big day indeed. It was a chilly but sunny fall
                morning. I held on tightly to my dad’s hand and made my way across the school field to the towering, red
                brick
                building. As we made our way to the classroom, I saw the other kids running up and hugging their friends
                and
                shouting what sounded to me like a jumble of gibberish. It all sounded so foreign.

                As my dad and I reached closer and closer to the classroom, 201, my heart began to race faster, and my
                throat
                dried up. I tried to take deep breaths, but it was as if I had forgotten how to. It was as if someone
                had
                placed a brick on my chest. We finally reached the classroom, which smelled of curry, a familiar smell
                that
                made me feel a bit better. The desks were formed in a rectangular shape around half the classroom and on
                each
                desk, I could see names scribbled at the top. My dad walked me to my desk and bid me goodbye and because
                he
                knew how nervous I was, said to me, “cinta koreo na.” I watched my dad leave and the other kids file in
                with
                their parents. On my desk, there was a cup of crayons and a coloring book. On the cover, I saw a picture
                of an
                elephant. Just as I began to open the book and take out the crayons out of the cup, I heard an elder
                woman’s
                voice. I can recall and mostly assume that she uttered something along the lines of:
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <br /><br />
          “Welcome, class! My name is Ms. Perez and I will be your teacher for second grade. In a second, I will ask
          each of you to go around and introduce yourself.”
          <br /><br />
          Immediately, I panicked. Since arriving in America, my cousins had taught me a few sayings and phrases, but
          the only one that echoed in my head was “I will kick you up in the sky!” It was one my cousins laughed at, but
          one I had grown quite fond of. I searched my brain for words and landed on “My name is Samira and I am from
          Bangladesh.” This was the first time I was speaking these words in my “broken” and desi accent in front of a
          group of strangers. So, I kept rehearsing in my head. My name is Samira and I am from Bangladesh. My name is
          Samira and I am from Bangladesh. My name is Samira and I am from Bangladesh... I wanted my first impression in
          front of these sea of unknown faces to be a good one. I didn’t want them to think that the only Bengali kid in
          class was “weird” or “dumb.”
          <br /><br />
          There were several people that introduced themselves, and then it was my turn. Oh, boy. Here I go. I slowly
          stood up and stuttered, “Hi, my...name...is Samira and I-I am from Bangladesh.” After I finished, I saw the
          teacher smile at me. There weren’t any sharp rulers in her hand. There was only kindness in her eyes. The
          brick on my chest felt a bit lighter.
          <br /><br />

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-8">
                Fast forward to two years later. In fourth grade, my speaking was much better than it had been two years
                prior. But I was still struggling with pretty everything else. I still felt that I was behind all my
                classmates. I was barely passing all my classes. The looks of disappointment every time my parents saw
                my
                report cards were soul-crushing. There was one person that was even more disappointed than they were. It
                was
                me. I kept having flashbacks of school in Bangladesh, of the end of the year ceremony, of the moments
                when I
                would be the twentieth person to walk onto the stage to receive my report card. While my friends came in
                first
                or second place and excitedly went up first to the stage to receive their prize, I looked down at my
                feet and
                hoped to be anywhere but there.

          I was much happier than I had been in school in Bangladesh, but it wasn’t exactly easy feeling like the “dumb”
          kid in class. Everyone seemed so much smarter.
          <br /><br />
          At the beginning of the year, we were assigned a reading level, represented by different colors. I remember
          barely getting through the reading assessment, and being assigned to read at the red level, which was far
          below the grade level.
          <br /><br />
          You’re dumb, and everyone here can see it, I said to myself one day during reading time, when everyone was
          choosing books from their designated reading level. I picked up a first-grade level picture book while the
          other kids conversed over The Babysitters Club.
          <br /><br />
          “Oh my god?! Did you read the fourth one?! It’s so good,” one girl hissed to her friend.
          <br /><br />
          “I really recommend you read The Babysitters Club. You are more than capable of reading chapter books as
          these,” I overheard my teacher tell another girl.
          <br /><br />
          <div>I opened <u>Frog and Toad are Friends</u>. “Frog walked into the house. It was dark…”

                Flashforward to present day: I am a freshman in college, ready to take my language and literacy skills
                to the
                next level. Until I started writing more about my language and literacy journey, I didn't realize the
                great
                impact that language has had in my life.

          Looking back, I wish I could give my younger self a hug. The first few years in America were truly the
          hardest. Everyone, from my teachers to my parents were pressuring me to do just as well as the kids who had
          grown up speaking, writing, and reading the same language their entire lives. It’s unfair to expect this level
          of proficiency in English so quickly from anyone, let alone a child.
          <br /><br />
          I am sure I am not alone when I say that moving across the world and adjusting to a new environment and
          culture is tough. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people immigrate to the United States. They leave
          behind everyone and everything they know in search of a better life. Some, like my parents, move because they
          want a better life for their children. Others move because they have no other choice.
          <br /><br />
          I wish society was kinder to immigrants. Over the past couple of years, the level of hatred against immigrants
          has risen significantly, not just in the U.S., but in the world. Humanity has lacked empathy towards
          immigrants. It makes me sad that we always must prove our loyalty to our country, that the same country we
          love and adore doesn’t always love us back. Sometimes, people fail to see that our country is better because
          immigrants are in it. Without immigrants, the U.S. wouldn’t be the “melting pot of cultures” it always markets
          itself as. America is not just one culture, religion, or language. It’s all the three hundred fifty languages,
          and it’s all the hundreds of cultures and religions and races. That’s what makes America great, not hate or
          fear.

                check
                homework. Sweat started slowly rolling down the right side of my face. My heart began to beat faster. I
                tried
                to keep my hands from shaking.

          <br /><br />
          I got one step closer. There were now 4 more people in front of me.

            <i>I will be fine. He will forget by lunch </i>, I reassured myself, half believing it. 3, 2, 1…

          “Next!” Mr. Akter barked.
          <br /><br />
          Mr. Akter was a miserable, middle aged man who seemed to only find happiness in yelling at his students. He
          was only five foot four inches. But to me, he seemed like a towering giant, ready to destroy all that angers
          him in his path. Mr. Akter was wearing a brown vest that looked like it had been worn for a very, very long
          time. He loved that damn vest. He also wore a mean, cruel scowl on his face.
          <br /><br />
          “Where’s your homework?” He growled, seeing my empty hands.
          <br /><br />
          “Uhh...mhm...you see....I...” My throat had closed.
          <br /><br />
          “You what?!” He eyed me suspiciously.
          <br /><br />
          “I didn’t do the homework.”
          <br /><br />
          “Hold out your palm,” he muttered.
          <br /><br />
          “I am so sorry-”
          <br /><br />
          “HOLD OUT YOUR HAND!” This time, he bellowed.
          <br /><br />
          I slowly put out my palm, hoping the bell would ring. Maybe the principal would come in.
          Oh please. He would just watch and have himself a show.
          <br /><br />
          <div><i>WHACK!</i> I felt the cold ruler slam against my palm. My palm turned a deep shade of pink. I walked
            back to my
            desk, looking down at my feet as the other kids laughed.</div>

          <b>2nd Grade</b>
          When I was eight years old, my family and I moved to America. All my life, I had only known one country,
          language, and culture. But suddenly, I was thrown into this whole new place. The first day of second grade was
          the first time I attended school in America, so it was a big day indeed. It was a chilly but sunny fall
          morning. I held on tightly to my dad’s hand and made my way across the school field to the towering, red brick
          building. As we made our way to the classroom, I saw the other kids running up and hugging their friends and
          shouting what sounded to me like a jumble of gibberish. It all sounded so foreign.
          <br /><br />
          <div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-8">
                As my dad and I reached closer and closer to the classroom, 201, my heart began to race faster, and my
                throat
                dried up. I tried to take deep breaths, but it was as if I had forgotten how to. It was as if someone
                had
                placed a brick on my chest. We finally reached the classroom, which smelled of curry, a familiar smell
                that
                made me feel a bit better. The desks were formed in a rectangular shape around half the classroom and on
                each
                desk, I could see names scribbled at the top. My dad walked me to my desk and bid me goodbye. Since he
                knew
                how nervous I was, he said to me, “cinta koreo na.” I watched my dad leave and the other kids file in
                with
                their parents. On my desk, there was a cup of crayons and a coloring book, which had a picture of an
                elephant
                its cover. Just as I began to open the book and take out the crayons out of the cup, I heard an elder
                woman’s
                voice. A five foot tall woman in her fifties walked into the room. She had a noticeable mole on the
                right
                cheek of her face, and she was wearing a bright, colorful dress. She had a warm smile plastered over her
                face.
                I can recall and mostly assume that she uttered something along the lines of:

          “Welcome, class! My name is Ms. Perez and I will be your teacher for second grade. I want each of you to go
          around and introduce yourself.”
          <br /><br />
          Immediately, I panicked. Since arriving in America, my cousins had taught me a few sayings and phrases, but
          the only one that echoed in my head was “I will kick you up in the sky!” It was one my cousins laughed at, but
          one I had grown quite fond of. I searched my brain for words and landed on “My name is Samira and I am from
          Bangladesh.” This was the first time I was speaking these words in my “broken” and desi accent in front of a
          group of strangers. So, I kept rehearsing in my head. My name is Samira and I am from Bangladesh. My name is
          Samira and I am from Bangladesh... I wanted my first impression in front of these sea of unknown faces to be a
          good one. I didn’t want them to think that the only Bengali kid in class was “weird” or “dumb.”
          There were several people that introduced themselves, and then it was my turn. Oh, boy. Here I go. I slowly
          stood up and stuttered, “Hi, my...name...is Samira and I-I am from Bangladesh..?” It was more of a question
          than a statement. But after I finished, I saw the teacher smile at me. There weren’t any sharp rulers in her
          hand. There was only kindness in her eyes. The brick on my chest felt a bit lighter.
          <br /><br />

          <b>4th Grade</b>
          <div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-8">
                Fast forward to two years later. In fourth grade, my speaking was much better than it had been two years
                prior. But I was still struggling with pretty much everything else. I still felt that I was behind all
                my
                classmates. I was barely passing all my classes. The looks of disappointment every time my parents saw
                my
                report cards were soul-crushing. There was one person that was even more disappointed than they were. It
                was
                me. I kept having flashbacks of school in Bangladesh, of the end of the year ceremony, of the moments
                when I
                would be the twentieth person to walk onto the stage to receive my report card. While my friends came in
                first
                or second place and excitedly went up first to the stage to receive their prize, I looked down at my
                feet and
                hoped to be anywhere but there.

          </div>

          <br /><br />
          I was much happier than I had been in school in Bangladesh, but it wasn’t exactly easy feeling like the “dumb”
          kid in class. Everyone seemed so much smarter.
          <br /><br />
          At the beginning of the year, we were assigned a reading level, represented by different colors. I remember
          barely getting through the reading assessment, and being assigned to read at the red level, which was far
          below the grade level.
          <br /><br />
          You’re dumb, and everyone here can see it, I said to myself one day during reading time, when everyone was
          choosing books from their designated reading level. I picked up a first-grade level picture book while the
          other kids conversed over The Babysitters Club.
          <br /><br />
          “Oh my god?! Did you read the fourth one?! It’s so good,” one girl whispered to her friend.
          <br /><br />
          “I really recommend you read The Babysitters Club. You are more than capable of reading chapter books as
          these,” I overheard my teacher tell another girl.
          <br /><br />
          I opened Frog and Toad are Friends. “Frog walked into the house. It was dark…”
          <br /><br />

          <b>Present Day</b>
          <div>
            Flashforward to present day: I am a freshman in college, ready to take my language and literacy skills to
            the
            next level. Until I started writing more about my language and literacy journey, I didn't realize the great
            impact that language has had in my life. Looking back, I wish I could give my younger self a hug. That day I
            received the WHACK! truly traumatized me. Even to this day, if I see a teacher being disrespected, something
            inside me dies. Although hitting students still may be allowed in many parts of Bangladesh and throughout
            the
            world, it is NOT okay. A child shouldn’t be hit in order to be disciplined. In many South Asian cultures, it
            is normalized for children to be not only hit, but beaten when they are younger. This truly traumatizes
            children, even way into their adulthoods, even as they are raising their own children. It’s a vicious cycle
            that will never end until our communities collectively began to recognize the impact of a beating or hit or
            slap. I know that for me, at least, the painful <i>WHACK!</i> on that faithful definitely has shaped me in
            ways I could have never imagined. </div>
