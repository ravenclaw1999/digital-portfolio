          The Rhetorical Analysis Essay was certainly more difficult than the Writing Language and Literacy Narrative.
          With the first essay, I had a much easier time because I was simply writing what I knew, knew what I felt. I
          knew the colors, feelings, and smells of the moments I wrote about. Everything easily poured out of me. On the
          other hand, with this essay, I had to take a step back, and write about a piece of writing someone else had
          written. I didn’t know what Amy Tan was feeling or thinking when she wrote “Mother Tongue.” I could only infer
          from the actual essay itself. Thus, it was quite challenging to tackle the Rhetorical Analysis Essay.
          <br /><br />
          At the beginning of the process of writing the Rhetorical Analysis Essay, I decided that my intended audience
          would be my classmates and professor. I knew that I wanted to write a more academic essay than my prior one.
          However, I still wanted to connect with my audience because I knew that many of them could relate to Amy Tan’s
          “Mother Tongue,” the essay that I ultimately wrote about. So, throughout my essay, I incorporated examples
          from “Mother Tongue” that many of classmates related to, and utilized words such as “we” and “our” to make the
          readers feel included.
          <br /><br />
          There are many insights I gained in this phase, and in writing the Rhetorical Analysis Essay. In writing this
          essay, I learned more about the rhetorical strategies that writers have in their toolbelt. I began to better
          recognize the different rhetorical appeals of pathos, logos, and ethos. With Tan’s essay, I specifically
          gained insight into how I can utilize my own personal examples and anecdotes to build a stronger argument. In
          addition, I learned more about concepts such as audience, argument, and evidence. I learned how to better
          tailor my writing to match my intended audience. Overall, I gained some really valuable experience in
          analyzing text.
          <br /><br />
          The Rhetorical Analysis Essay specifically helped me achieve the following Course Learning Outcomes: “explore
          and analyze, in writing and reading, a variety of genres and rhetorical situations,” and “recognize and
          practice key rhetorical terms and strategies when engaged in writing situations.” For instance, when I was
          examining “Mother Tongue,” I imagined a rhetorical situation venn diagram in my head. This helped me sort out
          the different aspects of Tan’s essay, and helped me get a better grip of her writing strategies. I explicitly
          explored the rhetorical strategies in my essay itself. In addition, with this essay, I realized that I needed
          to practice the key rhetorical strategies myself. For example, I started to utilize a lot of logos in my
          writing in order to demonstrate how Tan is most effective in her writing. Though this essay was a challenge, I
          began to understand how to analyze and recognize the rhetorical strategies better than ever before.

          In “Mother Tongue,” a personal essay published in The Threepenny Review in 1990, Amy Tan, best-selling author
          of The Joy Luck Club and Two Kinds, addresses the notion that her mother’s English is somehow “broken” or
          “limited.” Tan effectively utilizes excellent personal examples and anecdotes to support her argument. She
          makes use of all the rhetorical appeals of logos, ethos, and pathos. But she shines the most when she
          illustrates her relationship with her mother, and demonstrates how she uses language to communicate with her.
          In illustrating simple, yet important scenarios, she educates her readers about the importance of not only
          accepting, but embracing all of their “Englishes.”
          <br /><br />
          One feature of the text that stands out to the readers is Tan’s relationship with her mother. The majority of
          us, especially immigrants, have a complicated, yet important relationship with our mothers. They are our
          heroes and supporters. Thus, it is powerful when Tan demonstrates that she utilizes one of her Englishes to
          communicate with her mother. By making her mother the heart of her essay and utilizing pathos, she is able to
          obtain the sympathy and support of her readers. In the text, she concludes that language connects her to her
          mother by providing an anecdote of how she naturally switches her English. The author claims that, “It has
          become our language of intimacy, a different sort of English that relates to family talk, the language I grew
          up with.” Tan demonstrates the importance of language by providing this simple, yet impactful scenario that
          emphasizes her core argument that all “Englishes” should be accepted. By demonstrating the significance of
          language in her relationship with her mother, she justifies the importance of embracing her “Englishes.”
          <br /><br />
          In her essay, Tan also examines how she utilizes her “Englishes” to help her mother communicate with others.
          For example, she mentions that when she was younger, she used to pretend to be her mother on the phone so that
          her mother would be taken seriously. She even illustrates a humorous instance when she says that once she
          spoke on the phone with the stockbroker, pretending to be her mother, only for the stockbroker to find out
          that it was her all along. Tan illustrates that the stockbroker was wrong not to take her mother seriously
          because of how she spoke by satirizing her conversation with him. In addition to utilizing humor to support
          her argument, Tan provides serious and even life-threatening examples. Tan challenges the stigma of “broken”
          English by presenting the example of her mother at the hospital. After the hospital lost her mother’s CAT scan
          revealing possible brain tumors, they failed to apologize and help find the scan. But as soon as Tan herself
          talked to the hospital in her “perfect” English, they immediately resolved the issue, promising to find the
          scan. By providing this powerful example, Tan is demonstrating the consequences of neglecting someone because
          of the English they speak. She is emphasizing that societal rejection of English that does not follow the
          strict set of rules that academics and scholars often enforce can cause great struggle for those who may speak
          other “Englishes.” Therefore, Tan intentionally incorporates the anecdote of the hospital to drive home her
          pleas to accept all the “Englishes,” not just standardized English.
          <br /><br />
          Throughout the course of the text, Tan likewise inserts ethos and logos to support her argument that all
          “Englishes” should be accepted. For instance, she says that at a talk for her novel, she became more aware of
          the English she speaks. Tan recognized that she was using “carefully wrought grammatical phrases” in front of
          her mother. By acknowledging her own expertise in the English language and writing, she gains credibility with
          her readers, and she proves her investment in the issue at hand. However, it is important to note that Tan is
          subtle about her background. She is aware of her audience and and thereby, purposefully doesn’t mention that
          she majored in English and Linguistics. In dong this, the author is avoiding coming off as aggressive or
          pretentious to her larger audience. Nonetheless, Tan demonstrates that she is prepared to talk about the
          variations of English. Additionally, she evokes logos when she demonstrates the reasons behind why there are
          so few Asians in creative writing. She explains that from a young age, they are pushed towards subjects such
          as Math and Science rather than the humanities and writing. Tan is indicating that by pushing the notion of
          “standard” or “perfect” English, it is hurting the future generation of writers and poets. She does this by
          delving into her own struggles with the English language, such as identifying analogies. Tan showcases the
          cons of expecting everyone to fully learn and understand the rigid form of English by displaying her own
          struggles to the readers. Thus, in doing this, she is employing both pathos and logos to garner her audience’s
          attention.
          <br /><br />
          Tan’s “Mother Tongue” is an essay that many immigrants can relate to. It’s an exploration of the relationship
          immigrants have with language. We the readers can directly resonate with Tan’s stories. “Mother Tongue” is a
          great representation of what happens when an author takes it upon themselves to implement their own life
          stories and anecdotes to support their argument. Throughout the course of the essay, Tan uses examples from
          her own life, many of her mother, and many of her own encounters with standard English. Specifically, she
          centers a majority of her essay on her mother, who speaks English that people often consider to be “broken” or
          “limited.” Her personal anecdotes stand out to the audience, as they effectively portray the many points she
          argues in her essay, and as they showcase how “standardized” English can negatively impact her and the people
          she loves. Through the application of pathos, ethos, logos, and her own personal examples and anecdotes, she
          convinces the audience that they should utilize all the “Englishes” that they have, that the “standardized”
          English is not a reflection of “perfect” English, and that her mother tongue is actually “perfectly natural.”
          Therefore, Tan successfully proves her argument, and leaves her readers thinking about the many “Englishes”
          they should embrace.

          is) especially relevant and pivotal. Tan effectively utilizes excellent personal examples and anecdotes to
          support her argument. She makes use of all the rhetorical appeals of logos, ethos, and pathos. But she shines
